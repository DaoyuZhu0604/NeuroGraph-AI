# 🧠 Pose Estimation for Health Data Analysis  
**Advancing AI in Neuroscience and Psychology**

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository presents a unified and interpretable AI framework for analyzing complex health datasets in neuroscience and psychology. Our approach combines:

- **Dynamic Medical Graph Framework (DMGF)**: A temporal graph-based model capturing multimodal patient trajectories.
- **Attention-Guided Optimization Strategy (AGOS)**: An attention mechanism constrained by domain-specific knowledge to ensure interpretability and clinical alignment.

Together, they provide robust pipelines for:

- Disease progression modeling  
- Personalized treatment optimization  
- Public health trend prediction  
- Interpretable health data mining

---

## 🧠 Motivation

Modern health data is **heterogeneous**, **longitudinal**, and **multi-modal** — ranging from EHRs and wearable sensor signals to neuroimaging data. Traditional statistical or shallow-learning methods lack scalability and transparency.

Our solution addresses:

- 🔄 **Temporal Dependencies** via graph convolution across time  
- 🔗 **Structural Relationships** via patient-disease-attribute graphs  
- 🎯 **Feature Prioritization** using domain-informed attention  
- 🧬 **Interpretability** and ethical alignment for clinical use

## 🔍 Model Components

### 📦 DMGF (Dynamic Medical Graph Framework)
- Learns from **temporal graphs** built from patient data.
- Supports **disease-event modeling**, **inter-patient relation modeling**.
- Implements Temporal GCN layers.

### 🎯 AGOS (Attention-Guided Optimization Strategy)
- Adds **feature-wise attention** informed by domain constraints.
- Increases **interpretability and transparency**.
- Supports plug-in constraints for **clinical alignment**.

## 📊 Metrics & Evaluation

Evaluated on simulated and real-world datasets, including:

- Predictive accuracy (AUC, F1)
- Interpretability metrics (e.g., feature importance alignment)
- Ablation studies on attention, graph encoding, and constraints

> 📈 Results demonstrate significant performance improvement and better explanation quality than baselines.

---

## ✅ Testing

Run unit tests with:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Tests cover:
- Forward logic of DMGF & AGOS
- Attention consistency
- Graph loading and construction
